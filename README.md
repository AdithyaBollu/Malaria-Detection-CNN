# Malaria Detection Using CNN and Trasnfer Learning
## Overview
This project focuses on creating an AI model to classify a given image of a cell and classify if it has been infected with malaria or not. We started with an intially small data set seen in the `training` directory to test our model and see how it performs. 
The model performed really well since it was using the efficientnet architecture and produced a test data accuracy of 92.53% which is really solid. After I was satisifed with the resuls I decided to train the model
on the the real data seen in the `Real` directory which contains almost 13 thousand images for training and 6 thousand for testing. Training the model on this data took much longer, nearly 3 hours, but at the end we achieved and accuracy of 91.75% on our test data.

## Conclusion
From doing this project I realized the power of transfer learning in the world of AI and how it can improve our capabilities of making models quicker without compromising in accuracy.
